My current website! This is my ongoing Web Development Project using **React.js**, **Node.js** and **Figma** for design.  
Check out this quick demo to see how my website looks/works! If interested in checking out my project, its url is **ehongkuo.com**

## Features

### Hover Animations

An ongoing design choice I made was to have a consistent hover animation throughout the page. This was achieved with the CSS rule: ::hover.
